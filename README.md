# Student Tracking Database

## Overview

The Student Tracking Database is a comprehensive system designed to streamline the process of tracking and managing various data points for teachers over the course of the academic year. This web application is built using JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Express, and MySQL technologies. The goal is to provide a centralized platform where teachers can efficiently manage and access information related to students, tests, behavior incidents, interventions, and more.

## Problem Statement

Teachers, on average, have around 23 students in their class and need to track data for 3-6 different subjects, including tests, interventions, and behavior incidents. The current lack of a unified system forces teachers to navigate between different data sources, leading to a time-consuming and tedious process when generating report cards. Teachers spend approximately 20 hours per quarter, often working off-contract hours, to gather the required data for report cards. This cumulative effort amounts to around 80 hours per year.

## Solution

The Student Tracking Database aims to address this challenge by organizing and centralizing all necessary data, making it readily accessible for teachers. The system will simplify the report card generation process, allowing teachers to complete this task during their contract hours. The database is designed to be user-friendly and efficient, accommodating the needs of individual teachers in elementary, middle, and high schools.
